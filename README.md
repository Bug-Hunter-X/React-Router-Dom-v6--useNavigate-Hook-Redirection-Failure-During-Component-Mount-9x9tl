# React Router Dom v6: useNavigate Hook Redirection Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the `useNavigate` hook in React Router Dom v6: redirect failures during component mount.  The problem occurs when attempting to redirect before the component's state is fully initialized.

## Problem

The `useNavigate` hook, while powerful, requires the component to be fully mounted before attempting navigation.  Initiating a redirect within `useEffect` with an empty dependency array (meaning it runs once on mount) might lead to the redirect failing silently or causing unexpected behavior.  This is because the component's state might not be correctly set up yet.

## Solution

The provided solution addresses the problem by using a conditional redirect within `useEffect`.  The redirect happens only after a condition (in this example, a timeout) is met, guaranteeing that the component has enough time to initialize.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm start`
4. Observe the behavior in both the `bug.js` (demonstrates the problem) and `bugSolution.js` (shows the solution) examples.
